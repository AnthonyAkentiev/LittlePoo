********************************************************************

The game was written from scratch in a very "fast" fashion.

It runs on:
1) Apple iPod Touch 4G / iPhone 4
2) Apple iPad 1/2

Known bugs:
1) Collision detection: depends on current CPU usage :-))) 
2) High memory consumption: when multiple scenes are played -> crashreporter writes some kind of "Low memory" message to log.
3) Very poor performance: a bit of optimizations in collision detection/sprite movements required.
4) Camera movement is bad when dialogue is started.
